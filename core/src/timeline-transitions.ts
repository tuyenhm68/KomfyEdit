/**
 * Placing, moving and removing transitions on a timeline.
 *
 * The rule that shapes everything here: a transition is an OVERLAP. The two
 * pictures genuinely coexist for `d` seconds, straddling the cut — the left
 * clip plays `d/2` past it, the right clip starts `d/2` early.
 *
 * Crucially, that time is bought with media the clips were already trimming
 * away, not with time on the timeline. Both clips keep the edges the user can
 * see — `a` starts where it started, `b` ends where it ended — and nothing
 * downstream moves. Re-timing the effect therefore changes the effect and
 * nothing else, which is what makes dragging a handle feel like resizing a
 * band rather than shoving the film about.
 *
 * A clip with no spare frames cannot lend any, and then the other side covers
 * the difference; a still lends without limit, having no source to run out of.
 * Only when both are exhausted does the timeline itself pay, by closing up and
 * getting shorter — the one case where clips visibly move, and the UI says so.
 * `leftExtend` and `rightExtend` record what each clip actually lent, so
 * removal gives back exactly that and reopens exactly what was closed.
 *
 * All of it is pure: these take a timeline and return a new one, so the editor
 * store, the undo stack and the MCP patch executor share one implementation.
