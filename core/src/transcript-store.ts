/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The transcript every speech feature reads from.

   Captions, Auto Highlights and B-roll Copilot all need the same thing —
   what was said, and when — but each used to source it differently:
   captions called Whisper and threw the segments away, highlights called
   Whisper again, and B-roll read the caption cues. So the same recording was
   transcribed twice, and two of the three were reading captions that smart
   chunking had already cut into three-word scraps.

   Stored against the source asset, in the media's own seconds, because that
   is the only frame of reference that survives editing. A clip moved along
   the timeline, re-trimmed, or sped up still points at the same recording:
   re-trimming then just selects a different window of a transcript that is
   already on disk, rather than paying for Whisper again.
