# Changelog

What changed, release by release, as a user would see it.

The section for the version being released is cut out by
`scripts/release-notes.cjs` and becomes the body of the GitHub Release — which
is also the text the in-app updater shows when it offers a new version. So write
it for someone editing video, not for a developer: say what changed and what it
means for them, not which function moved.

A release with no section here is refused by CI before anything is built.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- **Sound Effects Library.** 29 studio-quality sound effects built into the Audio
  tab, organised across 7 categories: Transitions, Accents & UI, Notifications &
  Games, Impacts & Hits, Comedy & Meme, and Foley & Ambience. Click to preview
  with instant play/pause, and click '+' to insert directly onto audio track A2
  at your playhead. You can also import and organise your own external sound effect files.
- **Animated Stickers.** 39 new animated stickers (Google Noto Emoji) with transparent
  alpha channels across reactions, celebrations, hearts, and gestures. Filter by the
  new "Animated" pill in the Stickers tab, and export with seamless looping animation
  throughout the clip duration.
- **Bilingual search & localization.** Complete Vietnamese and English translations
  for all 29 sound effects and their acoustic usage tips. The search bar now matches
  both Vietnamese and English names, descriptions, and keywords dynamically.
- **Templates.** Save the edit you are looking at — its cuts, effects, text and
  transitions — and put new footage through it on your next video. The footage
  on the main track becomes the slots you fill in later; your media is never
  stored in the template. Applying one builds a **new timeline** beside the one
  you are working in, so nothing you have done is overwritten and you can play
  both before choosing. A template also carries its own music and overlays, so
  a saved edit sounds and looks the same next time; that media is copied into
  the project when you apply it, so the project does not depend on the template
  staying where it is. Each one can carry a cover picture taken from your first
  shot, so you recognise it in the list — that is a frame of your own footage,
  so it is a tick box rather than something that just happens. Templates are
  files under your presets folder, and EditPilot can apply them too.
- Eight sample templates ship with the app, so the Templates tab is not empty on
  the first run: openers, montages, comparisons and text pieces. None of them
  carries music — what they carry is the cut rhythm, the framing moves and the
  titles. Apply one, change it, and save it as your own.
- The Templates tab is a browser rather than a list: shelves down the left side,
  a search box, filters for shape and for how many shots a template wants, and a
  two-column grid. A template with no cover picture is drawn as a diagram of
  itself — the frame in its real proportions and a block per shot — rather than
  left blank.
- Before a template is applied, the slot picker says what each clip you picked
  will actually do: play as it is, slow down to fill a slot it is short for, or
  leave the end of that slot empty. That was always decided somewhere; now it is
  decided in front of you.

### Fixed
- **Filter layer placement.** Adding a filter from the Filters library now always
  creates an independent Filter Adjustment Layer on the topmost video track rather
  than collapsing onto track V1 at the bottom or falling into the audio track.
  Clicking a filter while previewing video no longer replaces clip properties
  behind your back.
- **Timeline track dragging & layer creation.** Fixed vertical coordinate tracking
  across tracks, making it smooth and accurate to drag clips between layers. Fixed
  an issue where dragging a clip upwards to create a new track was undone by
  automatic track pruning.
- Clearing a cache freed nothing, and said it had worked. Every cache the app
  offers to empty — the draft cache, the render cache, proxies — plus the
  temporary folders EditPilot leaves behind, kept growing on disk for anyone
  whose Windows account name is not plain English, because the deletion was
  silently refusing any path with an accented character in it. Deleting a
  template with a Vietnamese name had the same problem.

### Changed
- Auto Highlights and B-roll Copilot now think only through the CLI you set up
  in EditPilot. Neither falls back to an OpenAI key any more, and when no CLI is
  configured they say so and offer to open EditPilot instead of quietly using
  something else.
- B-roll suggestions are written by that CLI rather than assembled from the most
  frequent words in the sentence, so a spot is described by what to film —
  "close-up of a 3D model turning under light, showing the polished metal and
  the frosted shell" — instead of by tags like `#độ #chỉ #tạo`. Where each
  cutaway goes is still worked out locally from the transcript.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- Speech is transcribed once and shared. Auto captions, Auto Highlights and
  B-roll Copilot all read the same transcript, which is saved with the project,
  so the second and third of them cost nothing and work offline. Re-trimming a
  clip reads the words it still covers instead of transcribing again.
- Auto Highlights has its own **Create transcript** button, with a choice of
  whether the words should also appear as captions on the timeline. Analysing no
  longer starts a transcription behind your back.
- Highlights and hooks are written by the CLI you configured in EditPilot
  (Claude Code, Codex or Antigravity), so the feature no longer needs a separate
  OpenAI key. It falls back to OpenAI when no CLI is installed.
- B-roll Copilot lets you choose which footage to insert, and offers to import
  media when the project has none to spare.
- B-roll is inserted on its own **B-roll** track, created once and reused, so it
  can never land among the captions or on the footage it is covering.

### Fixed
- Caption progress read in Vietnamese while the app was set to English.
- EditPilot would not start with Codex CLI, failing with
  `unknown option '--skip-git-repo-check'`. On a machine with Claude Code also
  installed, it was launching Claude Code's program and handing it Codex's
  instructions.
- EditPilot with Codex could see KomfyEdit's tools but not use any of them, and
  reported that its permissions blocked access to the video.
- Clicking a timecode on EditPilot's confirmation card left the playhead where it
  was when the video was playing.
- Auto Highlights suggested segments that had nothing to do with the video: it
  was asking for highlights without sending any transcript, and the suggestions
  were invented. It now refuses rather than guessing.
- B-roll Copilot reported nothing to do on videos that are solid speech. It was
  counting the audio track — and, in a captioned project, the video itself — as
  footage already covering the picture, and it broke a stretch of talking apart
  at every breath between sentences.
- Inserting B-roll appeared to succeed but changed nothing on screen: the clip
  was placed among the captions, where nothing draws it, and it reused the video
  being edited, so it was the same picture either way.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- EditPilot's confirmation card lists each cut it is about to make: click a row
  to jump the playhead there, and untick anything you would rather keep.
- The first video added to a new project now sets the project's frame size.

### Fixed
- Ctrl+B cuts at the playhead instead of at the mouse pointer.
- The preview no longer flickers when playback passes a sticker.
- Video filmed upright on a phone is no longer treated as landscape, so the crop
  frame and transform handles sit on the picture.
- Clip volume can be raised above 100% from the properties panel.
- Auto captions cover the whole timeline after a video has been cut, instead of
  stopping at the first cut.
- The app icon shows correctly on the Windows taskbar, in both the installed and
  the development build.
- Adding a sticker no longer leaves a blank image tile in the Import panel.
